# 🧮 Math Matching Game (MIPS Assembly)

This project is a simple **Math Matching Game** written in **MIPS Assembly** and executed using the **MARS (MIPS Assembler and Runtime Simulator)** environment. The goal of the game is to test and improve the user's ability to match math problems with their correct answers through console-based interaction.

## 🛠️ Features

- Displays a set of randomized math problems (addition, subtraction, etc.)
- Shuffles and presents answer choices
- User selects the correct match via keyboard input
- Score tracking for correct and incorrect matches
- Input validation and feedback system
- Designed to run in the MARS console environment

## 💻 Requirements

- [MARS MIPS Simulator](http://courses.missouristate.edu/kenvollmar/mars/)

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Open the `.asm` file in the MARS interpreter.
3. Assemble the program (`F3` or `Assemble`).
4. Run the program (`F5` or `Go`).
5. Follow on-screen instructions to play the game.
